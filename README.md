# FCI_Employee-Login
An HRMS system for FCI (Food Corporation of India).

This android application was made for the employees working at the Food Corporation of India. This is a HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. It helps the employees of the FCI to get their details off of the database of the Food Corporation of India.

This application communicates through the php that are stored on the server and communicates with the database. The android application has features like signup, login and change password and details viewing. You cannot edit any information using this application.

It uses the ASYNCTASK function to make a http request to the server and the data is transferred using POST method as the data remains hidden.

Note: This application is not an official application of the #Food Corporation of India. It was developed by us at the time of our internship at FCI.

Please do not distribute this application.
